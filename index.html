                <p>'Don't waste your breath!' yelled <span class="tooltip-activator">Colm</span>, his eyes screwed up against the pain in his scar, now more terrible than ever. 'He can't hear you from here!'
                </p>
                <p>    'Can't I, <span class="tooltip-activator">O'hAonghusa</span>?' said a high, cold voice.
                </p>
                <p>    <span class="tooltip-activator">Colm</span> opened his eyes.
                </p>
                <p>    Tall, thin and black-hooded, his terrible snakelike face white and gaunt, his scarlet, slit-pupilled eyes staring . . . Lord <span class="tooltip-activator">Dara</span> had appeared in the middle of the hall, his wand pointing at <span class="tooltip-activator">Colm</span> who stood frozen, quite unable to move.
                </p>
                <p>    'So, you smashed my prophecy?' said <span class="tooltip-activator">Dara</span> softly, staring at <span class="tooltip-activator">Colm</span> with those pitiless red eyes. 'No, <span class="tooltip-activator">Alexey</span>, he is not lying . . . I see the truth looking at me from within his worthless mind . . . months of preparation, months of effort . . . and my Death Eaters have let <span class="tooltip-activator">Colm</span> <span class="tooltip-activator">O'hAonghusa</span> thwart me again . . .'
                </p>
                <p>    'Master, I am sorry, I knew not, I was fighting <span class="tooltip-activator">Luke</span>!' sobbed <span class="tooltip-activator">Alexey</span>, flinging herself down at <span class="tooltip-activator">Dara</span>'s feet as he paced slowly nearer. 'Master, you should know - '
                </p>
                <p>    'Be quiet, <span class="tooltip-activator">Alexey</span>,' said <span class="tooltip-activator">Dara</span> dangerously. 'I shall deal with you in a moment. Do you think I have entered the Ministry of Magic to hear your snivelling apologies?'
                </p>
                <p>    'But Master - he is here - he is below - '
                </p>
                <p>    <span class="tooltip-activator">Dara</span> paid no attention.
                </p>
                <p>    'I have nothing more to say to you, <span class="tooltip-activator">O'hAonghusa</span>,' he said quietly. 'You have irked me too often, for too long. AVADA KEDAVRA!'
                </p>
                <p>    <span class="tooltip-activator">Colm</span> had not even opened his mouth to resist; his mind was blank, his wand pointing uselessly at the floor.
                </p>
                <p>    But the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had sprung alive, leaping from its plinth to land with a crash on the floor between <span class="tooltip-activator">Colm</span> and <span class="tooltip-activator">Dara</span>. The spell merely glanced off its chest as the statue flung out its arms to protect <span class="tooltip-activator">Colm</span>.
                </p>
                <p>    'What - ?' cried <span class="tooltip-activator">Dara</span>, staring around. And then he breathed, '<span class="tooltip-activator">Fionn</span>!'
                </p>
                <p>    <span class="tooltip-activator">Colm</span> looked behind him, his heart pounding. <span class="tooltip-activator">Fionn</span> was standing in front of the golden gates.
                </p>
                <p>    <span class="tooltip-activator">Dara</span> raised his wand and another jet of green light streaked at <span class="tooltip-activator">Fionn</span>, who turned and was gone in a whirling of his cloak. Next second, he had reappeared behind <span class="tooltip-activator">Dara</span> and waved his wand towards the remnants of the fountain. The other statues sprang to life. The statue of the witch ran at <span class="tooltip-activator">Alexey</span>, who screamed and sent spells streaming uselessly off its chest, before it dived at her, pinning her to the floor. Meanwhile, the goblin and the house-elf scuttled towards the fireplaces set along the wall and the one-armed centaur galloped at <span class="tooltip-activator">Dara</span>, who vanished and reappeared beside the pool. The headless statue thrust <span class="tooltip-activator">Colm</span> backwards, away from the fight, as <span class="tooltip-activator">Fionn</span> advanced on <span class="tooltip-activator">Dara</span> and the golden centaur cantered around them both.
                </p>
                <p>    'It was foolish to come here tonight, <span class="tooltip-activator">Dara</span>,' said <span class="tooltip-activator">Fionn</span> calmly. The <span class="tooltip-activator">Plagiarism Committee</span> are on their way - '
                </p>
                <p>    'By which time I shall be gone, and you will be dead!' spat <span class="tooltip-activator">Dara</span>. He sent another killing curse at <span class="tooltip-activator">Fionn</span> but missed, instead hitting the security guard's desk, which burst into flame.
                </p>
                <p>    <span class="tooltip-activator">Fionn</span> flicked his own wand: the force of the spell that emanated from it was such that <span class="tooltip-activator">Colm</span>, though shielded by his golden guard, felt his hair stand on end as it passed and this time <span class="tooltip-activator">Dara</span> was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect it. The spell, whatever it was, caused no visible damage to the shield, though a deep, gong-like note reverberated from it - an oddly chilling sound.
                </p>
                <p>    'You do not seek to kill me, <span class="tooltip-activator">Fionn</span>?' called <span class="tooltip-activator">Dara</span>, his scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of the shield. 'Above such brutality, are you?'
                </p>
                <p>    'We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man, <span class="tooltip-activator">Dara</span>,' <span class="tooltip-activator">Fionn</span> said calmly, continuing to walk towards <span class="tooltip-activator">Dara</span> as though he had not a fear in the world, as though nothing had happened to interrupt his stroll up the hall. 'Merely taking your life would not satisfy me, I admit - '
                </p>
                <p>    There is nothing worse than death, <span class="tooltip-activator">Fionn</span>!' snarled <span class="tooltip-activator">Dara</span>.
                </p>
                <p>    'You are quite wrong,' said <span class="tooltip-activator">Fionn</span>, still closing in upon <span class="tooltip-activator">Dara</span> and speaking as lightly as though they were discussing the matter over drinks. <span class="tooltip-activator">Colm</span> felt scared to see him walking along, undefended, shieldless; he wanted to cry out a warning, but his headless guard kept shunting him backwards towards the wall, blocking his every attempt to gel out from behind it. 'Indeed, your failure to understand that there are things much worse than death has always been your greatest weakness - '
                </p>
                <p>    Another jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield. This time it was the one-armed centaur, galloping in front of <span class="tooltip-activator">Fionn</span>, that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces, but before the fragments had even hit the floor, <span class="tooltip-activator">Fionn</span> had drawn back his wand and waved it as though brandishing a whip. A long thin flame flew from the tip; it wrapped itself around <span class="tooltip-activator">Dara</span>, shield and all. For a moment, it seemed <span class="tooltip-activator">Fionn</span> had won, but then the fiery rope became a serpent, which relinquished its hold on <span class="tooltip-activator">Dara</span> at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face <span class="tooltip-activator">Fionn</span>.
                </p>
                <p>    <span class="tooltip-activator">Dara</span> vanished; the snake reared from the floor, ready to strike - '
                </p>
                <p>    There was a burst of flame in midair above <span class="tooltip-activator">Fionn</span> just as <span class="tooltip-activator">Dara</span> reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently the five statues had stood.
                </p>
                <p>    'Look out!' <span class="tooltip-activator">Colm</span> yelled.
                </p>
                <p>    But even as he shouted, another jet of green light flew at <span class="tooltip-activator">Fionn</span> from <span class="tooltip-activator">Dara</span>'s wand and the snake struck - '
                </p>
                <p>    Fawkes swooped down in front of <span class="tooltip-activator">Fionn</span>, opened his beak wide and swallowed the jet of green light whole: he burst into flame and fell to the floor, small, wrinkled and flightless. At the same moment, <span class="tooltip-activator">Fionn</span> brandished his wand in one long, fluid movement - the snake, which had been an instant from sinking its fangs into him, flew high into the air and vanished in a wisp of dark smoke; and the water in the pool rose up and covered <span class="tooltip-activator">Dara</span> like a cocoon of molten glass.
                </p>
                <p>    For a few seconds <span class="tooltip-activator">Dara</span> was visible only as a dark, rippling, faceless figure, shimmering and indistinct upon the plinth, clearly struggling to throw off the suffocating mass - '
                </p>
                <p>    Then he was gone and the water fell with a crash back into its pool, slopping wildly over the sides, drenching the polished floor.</p>
